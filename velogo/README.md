A Flutter application for cycling route planning and tracking with Clean Architecture.

## Architecture

This project follows Clean Architecture principles with Feature-first organization:

- **Domain Layer** - Business logic, entities, and use cases
- **Data Layer** - Data sources, models, and repository implementations
- **Presentation Layer** - UI components, BLoCs, and pages

## Features

- âœ… **Auth Feature** - User authentication and registration
- âœ… **Map Feature** - Route planning and tracking
- âœ… **Weather Feature** - Weather information for routes
- âœ… **Navigation Feature** - App navigation and theme management
- âœ… **Profile Feature** - User profile management
- ðŸ”„ **Settings Feature** - App settings (in progress)

## Firebase Configuration

### Security Rules

Firebase Firestore security rules are configured to ensure data protection:

- Users can only access their own data
- Authentication is required for all operations
- Default deny policy for unknown collections

See [FIREBASE_SECURITY.md](FIREBASE_SECURITY.md) for detailed security configuration.

### Collections

- `users/{userId}` - User authentication data
- `profiles/{userId}` - User profile information
- `routes/{routeId}` - Cycling routes (planned)
- `settings/{userId}` - User settings (planned)
